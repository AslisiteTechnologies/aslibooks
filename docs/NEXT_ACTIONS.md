## Current checkpoint

Recovery head `37e20d201df008db80774da73c3fd69056dc2666` contains all nine verified nonempty pagination files and CI #335 passed. Historical malformed head `64135f913bf234679408077212ba6f2c8b317e57` is retained as an incident record; CI/Mongo failed and E2E #53/#54 are invalid because the test file was empty. Commit `451031e3d496008cc00964dd1850794419b8342d` fixed the Coastal archive test fixture and passed CI #341/#342, MongoDB #278/#279 and E2E #61/#62.

Preserve the original workspace edits; never stage the owner-supplied vision file. Never merge PR #1 to `main` or deploy production.

## Current implementation task

Vendor payment race commit `af602ef7a9216a85ff08d5f9858b15a3660d8217` passed CI #433/#434, MongoDB #370/#371 and Browser #153/#154. Customer and vendor advance allocation race tests now each prove exactly one request can consume a shared remaining amount (focused suites 2/2); full replica-set workspace tests pass 136/136, with typecheck, lint, build, audit and diff check passing. Publish these advance race checks and refreshed evidence, then verify the exact SHA. Next work on network/retry failure behavior and remaining route-specific tenant/object-access gaps.

## Exact verification commands

```powershell
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
git diff --check
$env:MONGODB_TEST_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?replicaSet=rs0"
$env:MONGODB_TEST_DB_NAME="aslibooks_test_codex"
pnpm test
$env:PYTHONPATH="$env:TEMP\aslibooks-playwright-runtime"
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$env:TEMP\codex-aslibooks-browsers"
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\python\python.exe" apps/web/e2e/chart.py
```

For local integration/browser tests, use a disposable MongoDB replica set and API/web servers as described by `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` and `docs/integration-testing.md`. In this session, MongoDB ran locally on port 37491 with database names prefixed `aslibooks_test_`; API and Vite ran on ports 4000 and 5176. Do not point tests at production. If local services are unavailable, rely only on exact-commit GitHub workflow evidence and state which local tests were skipped.

## Remaining MVP work

- Reconcile every master vision acceptance criterion to implemented code and direct test evidence, especially cross-tenant object access and viewer/accountant permissions (matrix is in `docs/MVP_ACCEPTANCE_MATRIX.md`).
- Review invoice lifecycle, sales/purchase tax handling and credit/refund boundaries; keep unsupported GST cases blocked pending qualified review.
- Verify financial reports, aging, customer/vendor ledgers and source journal reconciliation against realistic transaction fixtures.
- Review AI isolation and explicit human approval; AI must not post.
- Complete threat review, least-privilege runtime DB role, backup/restore, monitoring, staging runbook and release checklist.
- Production email credentials/sender verification and live delivery require owner configuration; do not claim verified delivery without it.
