## Current checkpoint

Development branch head before current uncommitted AI slice: `8e6aec05400d4f726336ac7c5f83fe9fdaefab66`. The full paginated ledger CSV export passed CI #242 and MongoDB #179. Earlier email, fiscal close, GST review commits also passed their exact-commit checks. The optional AI report-explanation implementation is in local verification and must be committed and checked in CI before claiming remote completion. The owner-supplied vision document must remain unstaged.

## Current implementation task

AI report explanation: explicit user consent, allowlisted aggregate payload, Responses API structured schema with validation, provider storage disabled, no tools or posting capability. Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY` and optionally `OPENAI_MODEL` to enable; provider calls need live credential verification. Next, complete transfer/refund/advance workflows and secure attachments, then add browser coverage and continue release hardening. GST tax-bearing posting remains blocked pending qualified review; no live email delivery or production service is claimed.
## Exact verification commands

```powershell
pnpm --filter @aslibooks/api test -- src/accounting/gst.test.ts
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
git diff --check
$env:MONGODB_TEST_URI='mongodb://127.0.0.1:37491/?replicaSet=aslibooksLocal'
$env:MONGODB_TEST_DB_NAME='aslibooks_test_<unique_name>'
pnpm --filter @aslibooks/api test --maxWorkers=1 src/routes/products.integration.test.ts src/routes/invoices.integration.test.ts
pnpm --filter @aslibooks/api test --maxWorkers=1

```

If local Mongo is unavailable, use exact-commit MongoDB Actions evidence. Do not claim local integration or browser tests passed unless executed.

## Remaining MVP work

- GST: validated HSN/SAC/rate inputs, expert-reviewed applicability and rate tables, journal mappings, tax-aware credits/purchases and proper printable tax documents. Keep unsupported cases blocked and avoid compliance claims.
- Production email-provider credentials and sender-domain verification; live delivery and Better Auth end-to-end verification.
- Attachments metadata and secure storage policy; fiscal period correction/reopen policy.
- Transfers, advances, cash refunds, attachments, constrained AI assistance, and release hardening.
- Constrained AI explanation/draft extraction with explicit human approval and no direct posting capability.
- Tenant/role threat review, rate limits, session expiry UX, least-privilege runtime database role, staging/backup/restore/monitoring guide, desktop/mobile browser E2E and release checklist.

Never stage the owner-supplied vision file. Publish only to `develop/phase-1-foundation`, inspect the remote head before each expected-SHA update, never force push. Keep PR #1 draft, do not merge `main`, and do not deploy production.
