## Current checkpoint

Recovery head `37e20d201df008db80774da73c3fd69056dc2666` contains all nine verified nonempty pagination files and CI #335 passed. Historical malformed head `64135f913bf234679408077212ba6f2c8b317e57` is retained as an incident record; CI/Mongo failed and E2E #53/#54 are invalid because the test file was empty. Commit `451031e3d496008cc00964dd1850794419b8342d` fixed the Coastal archive test fixture and passed CI #341/#342, MongoDB #278/#279 and E2E #61/#62.

## Current implementation task

Per-contact subledger reconciliation `0c6fb67e20b3484b7939880b066c659730c5eac2` passed CI #411/#412, MongoDB #348/#349, and Browser #131/#132. The production audit exposed five Vitest/Tinypool findings through Better Auth's optional peer dependency. Local remediation upgrades workspace Vitest to 4.1.12, adds Vitest source-only discovery configs to prevent compiled `dist` test duplication, and passes `pnpm audit --prod` with no known vulnerabilities. Local replica-set suite passes 111 tests once (105 API, 5 accounting, 1 web); typecheck, lint, build, and diff check pass. The first publication's lockfile blob was truncated during transfer, causing frozen install failures before tests ran. A complete lockfile blob is reconstructed and verified; publish the correction, then verify exact-SHA CI/MongoDB/Browser before reconciling the remaining master acceptance criteria and security/release gaps.

## Exact verification commands

```powershell
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm build
git diff --check
pnpm --filter @aslibooks/api test --maxWorkers=1 src/routes/contacts.integration.test.ts
$env:PYTHONPATH="$env:TEMP\aslibooks-playwright-runtime"
$env:PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH="$env:TEMP\codex-aslibooks-browsers"
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.cache\codex-runtimes\codex-primary-runtime\dependencies\python\python.exe" apps/web/e2e/chart.py
```

For local integration/browser tests, use a disposable MongoDB replica set and API/web servers as described by `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` and `docs/integration-testing.md`. In this session, MongoDB ran locally on port 37491 with database names prefixed `aslibooks_test_`; API and Vite ran on ports 4000 and 5176. Do not point tests at production. If local services are unavailable, rely only on exact-commit GitHub workflow evidence and state which local tests were skipped.

## Remaining MVP work

- Publish and verify the Vitest 4.1.12 security/test-discovery change on its exact SHA.
- Reconcile every master vision acceptance criterion to implemented code and direct test evidence, especially cross-tenant object access and viewer/accountant permissions.
- Review invoice lifecycle, sales/purchase tax handling and credit/refund boundaries; keep unsupported GST cases blocked pending qualified review.
- Verify financial reports, aging, customer/vendor ledgers and source journal reconciliation against realistic transaction fixtures.
- Review AI isolation and explicit human approval; AI must not post.
- Complete threat review, least-privilege runtime DB role, backup/restore, monitoring, staging runbook and release checklist.
- Production email credentials/sender verification and live delivery require owner configuration; do not claim verified delivery without it.
