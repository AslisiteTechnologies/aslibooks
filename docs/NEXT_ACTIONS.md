'# Next actions

## Current checkpoint

Development head `3363e799b9902f8022c6bc496b977f29a01f4b5a` passed CI #322, MongoDB #259 and browser E2E #42. Unit-aware sales and receipt/bill/banking workflows completed in the browser. Product edit UI is implemented locally and needs exact-commit verification. Preserve original workspace edits; never stage the owner-supplied vision file.

## Current implementation task

Verify product edit UI with `pnpm test`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, and Playwright. Confirm product name/unit/price updates persist and invoice unit snapshots remain accurate. Publish changed files only to `develop/phase-1-foundation`, inspect CI/MongoDB/browser Actions and fix failures. Continue to the next incomplete MVP requirement after this feature passes.

'## Exact verification commands

If local Mongo is unavailable, use exact-commit MongoDB Actions evidence. Do not claim local integration or browser tests passed unless executed.

## Remaining MVP work

- GST: validated HSN/SAC/rate inputs, expert-reviewed applicability and rate tables, journal mappings, tax-aware credits/purchases and proper printable tax documents. Keep unsupported cases blocked and avoid compliance claims.
- Production email-provider credentials and sender-domain verification; live delivery and Better Auth end-to-end verification.
- Attachments metadata and secure storage policy; fiscal period correction/reopen policy.
- Transfers and customer/vendor advances are implemented; cash refund of an unallocated customer advance is in progress. Attachments and release hardening remain.
- Constrained AI explanation/draft extraction with explicit human approval and no direct posting capability.
- Tenant/role threat review, rate limits, session expiry UX, least-privilege runtime database role, staging/backup/restore/monitoring guide, desktop/mobile browser E2E and release checklist.

Never stage the owner-supplied vision file. Publish only to `develop/phase-1-foundation`, inspect the remote head before each expected-SHA update, never force push. Keep PR #1 draft, do not merge `main`, and do not deploy production.
