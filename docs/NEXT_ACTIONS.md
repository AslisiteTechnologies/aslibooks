## Current checkpoint

Development branch head `c7cf7c7b760d9127e3c6afa30c61fe7df9d7f9e4`. AI report explanations passed CI #244/MongoDB #181; internal cash/bank transfers passed CI #246/MongoDB #183. CI #248 passed; MongoDB #185 ran customer advances successfully but found one stale starter-chart row-count assertion (expected 23 rather than 24). That assertion is corrected locally and requires a follow-up commit/workflow. The owner-supplied vision document must remain unstaged.

## Current implementation task

Finish the starter-chart assertion correction and rerun both workflows. Customer advances use liability account 2210, atomic received-cash journal and same-customer invoice allocation, transactionally updated availability, invoice payment update, audit, idempotency, and explicit review dialogs. The customer-advance integration test passed on MongoDB CI #185. Next implement vendor advances/refunds or secure attachments, browser coverage and release hardening. AI needs optional `OPENAI_API_KEY` and has no live-provider test. GST tax-bearing posting remains blocked pending qualified review; no live email delivery or production service is claimed.

If local Mongo is unavailable, use exact-commit MongoDB Actions evidence. Do not claim local integration or browser tests passed unless executed.

## Remaining MVP work

- GST: validated HSN/SAC/rate inputs, expert-reviewed applicability and rate tables, journal mappings, tax-aware credits/purchases and proper printable tax documents. Keep unsupported cases blocked and avoid compliance claims.
- Production email-provider credentials and sender-domain verification; live delivery and Better Auth end-to-end verification.
- Attachments metadata and secure storage policy; fiscal period correction/reopen policy.
- Transfers, advances, cash refunds, attachments, constrained AI assistance, and release hardening.
- Constrained AI explanation/draft extraction with explicit human approval and no direct posting capability.
- Tenant/role threat review, rate limits, session expiry UX, least-privilege runtime database role, staging/backup/restore/monitoring guide, desktop/mobile browser E2E and release checklist.

Never stage the owner-supplied vision file. Publish only to `develop/phase-1-foundation`, inspect the remote head before each expected-SHA update, never force push. Keep PR #1 draft, do not merge `main`, and do not deploy production.
